## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project dragged, sadly partly because of Childcare and Property Management responsibilities. But in all the learnings were massive, and include:

- That when it comes to an element's background CSS property, you can use ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to style some part of said element.
- Proper use of Next.js Image component.
- That in React, the "for" attribute should be substituted with the "htmlFor" attribute instead.
- Computed property names in Objects.

### Continued development

- 1 more Next.js Project, then onto Open Source and Technical Writing.
